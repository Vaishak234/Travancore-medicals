      "BiPAP (Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure) machines deliver two different pressure levels - a higher pressure during inhalation (IPAP) and a lower pressure during exhalation (EPAP). This makes breathing more natural and comfortable, especially for patients who need higher pressure support or have difficulty exhaling against CPAP pressure. Our BiPAP devices feature advanced algorithms for optimal patient-ventilator synchrony. Ideal for patients with COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, central sleep apnea, and complex sleep-disordered breathing. Supports multiple ventilation modes including spontaneous (S), spontaneous-timed (ST), and timed (T) modes.",
